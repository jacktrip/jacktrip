\begin_layout Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive packet loss concealment (PLC) system designed for real-time networked audio applications,
 featuring adaptive queue management and autoregressive prediction.
 The proposed

 architecture combines multi-threaded packet buffering with Burg algorithm-based audio prediction to maintain continuous audio playback despite network packet loss.
 Key innovations include an adaptive worker thread that dynamically adjusts queue target sizes based on underrun patterns,
 per-channel autoregressive modeling for high-quality audio prediction,
 and comprehensive real-time performance monitoring.
 The system supports multiple audio channels,
 variable bit depths,
 and different frame sizes while maintaining low-latency operation suitable for interactive audio applications.
 Experimental evaluation demonstrates effective concealment of packet losses up to [X]% with minimal perceptual artifacts,
 while the adaptive queue management reduces underruns by [Y]% compared to fixed-size buffering approaches.
 The architecture's modular design enables deployment across various network audio scenarios,
 from music performance to voice communication systems.
 Statistical analysis reveals consistent performance under varying network conditions,
 with automatic adaptation to network jitter and variable latency patterns.
 The implementation provides a practical solution for maintaining audio quality in unreliable network environments while preserving the real-time constraints essential for interactive audio applications.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Network audio applications face significant challenges when operating over unreliable networks where packet loss,
 jitter,
 and variable latency can severely degrade audio quality
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Traditional approaches to handling packet loss in audio streams typically involve either simple silence insertion,
 packet repetition or basic interpolation techniques,
 all of which produce audible artifacts that compromise the listening experience

 For interactive applications such as networked music performance,

 maintaining continuous,
 high-quality audio output is critical for user experience and application viability

\begin_layout Standard
The problem becomes particularly acute in real-time scenarios where buffering must be minimized to maintain interactive responsiveness
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Unlike streaming applications that can afford larger buffers to smooth over network irregularities,
 interactive audio applications require solutions that balance audio quality preservation with minimal latency penalties

 This necessitates sophisticated packet loss concealment strategies that can predict missing audio content with sufficient quality to mask brief interruptions.

Regulator
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is loosely inspired by an analogy to the regulators used in SCUBA breathing apparatus.
 It takes after the concept that the diver pulls air from a flow being pushed by the tank pressure.
 If the flow slackens the demand valve engages but if the flow exceeds demand pressure relief occurs.

\begin_layout Section
System Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Regulator system employs a multi-layered architecture designed to handle packet loss concealment while maintaining real-time performance constraints.
 The design centers around four primary components that work in concert to provide seamless audio playback despite network irregularities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Core Components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Regulator Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central 
\family typewriter
Regulator
\family default
 class inherits from 
\family typewriter
RingBuffer
\family default
 and serves as the main orchestrator for packet loss concealment operations.
 It manages the interface between incoming network packets and outgoing audio callbacks,
 handling timing synchronization,
 adaptive tolerance management,
 and coordination between prediction and buffering subsystems.
 The class maintains separate frame-per-packet (FPP) configurations for local audio interface (
\family typewriter
mLocalFPP
\family default
) and peer network packets (
\family typewriter
mPeerFPP
\family default
),
 enabling operation across different buffer sizes and sample rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
BurgAlgorithm Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
BurgAlgorithm
\family default
 class implements the maximum entropy method for autoregressive coefficient estimation and prediction.
 The algorithm operates in two phases:
 training,
 where it analyzes historical audio data to compute optimal AR coefficients using the Burg recursion,
 and prediction,
 where these coefficients are applied to forecast missing audio samples.
 The implementation includes numerical stability enhancements such as damping factors and epsilon guards to prevent division by zero conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Channel Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each audio channel is managed by a dedicated 
\family typewriter
Channel
\family default
 instance that maintains independent state for prediction operations.
 The class manages multiple audio buffers including 
\family typewriter
realNowPacket
\family default
 for current received audio,
 
\family typewriter
predictedNowPacket
\family default
 for generated replacement audio,
 and 
\family typewriter
outputNowPacket
\family default
 for the final output.
 A circular ring buffer (
\family typewriter
mPacketRing
\family default
) stores recent packet history for training data,
 while prediction coefficients and intermediate processing buffers support the AR modeling process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
RegulatorWorker Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optional 
\family typewriter
RegulatorWorker
\family default
 provides asynchronous packet processing through a dedicated high-priority thread.
 When prediction computations exceed 70% of the local audio callback interval,
 the system automatically enables the worker to maintain real-time performance.
 The worker maintains its own packet queue (
\family typewriter
WaitFreeFrameBuffer
\family default
) with adaptive sizing that responds to underrun conditions by incrementally increasing the queue target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adaptive Mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tolerance Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system implements sophisticated adaptive tolerance control through the 
\family typewriter
StdDev
\family default
 statistics class.
 Two separate statistical analyzers track push timing (incoming packets) and pull timing (audio callbacks),
 computing rolling means,
 standard deviations,
 and long-term trends.
 The adaptive algorithm adjusts 
\family typewriter
mMsecTolerance
\family default
 based on network jitter patterns,
 automatically increasing headroom when glitch rates exceed configurable thresholds (0.6% by default).
 This enables the system to maintain audio continuity across varying network conditions without manual intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Packet Selection Logic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The packet retrieval mechanism in 
\family typewriter
pullPacket()
\family default
 implements an intelligent selection algorithm that examines recent arrivals to find the optimal packet for playback.
 The system maintains a circular buffer of the most recent 4096 packet slots with associated timestamps,
 allowing it to account for out-of-order delivery and variable latency.
 When multiple packets are available,
 the algorithm selects the packet that best balances recency with the current tolerance threshold,
 skipping packets that are either too old or represent significant temporal gaps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi-Threading Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system employs a carefully designed threading model that separates time-critical audio processing from computationally intensive prediction operations.
 The main thread handles incoming packet reception and audio interface callbacks,
 while the optional worker thread processes prediction algorithms at real-time priority.
 Communication between threads uses lock-free data structures (
\family typewriter
WaitFreeFrameBuffer
\family default
) and atomic operations to minimize latency and avoid priority inversion.
 The worker thread activation is automatic and transparent,
 triggered when prediction latency threatens real-time audio delivery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cross-fade and Glitch Handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To minimize audible artifacts during transitions between predicted and real audio,
 the system implements sophisticated cross-fading mechanisms.
 When transitioning from a predicted packet back to a received packet,
 the algorithm applies complementary fade curves (
\family typewriter
mFadeUp
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
mFadeDown
\family default
) that blend the predicted future packet with the newly arrived real data.
 This approach eliminates discontinuities that would otherwise produce audible clicks or pops during recovery from packet loss events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Format and Rate Adaptation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture accommodates different audio bit depths (8,
 16,
 24,
 32-bit) and supports mismatched frame sizes between local audio interfaces and network packet formats.
 The 
\family typewriter
FPPratio
\family default
 mechanism handles cases where peer and local frame sizes differ,
 automatically segmenting or aggregating packets to match interface requirements.
 This flexibility enables deployment across heterogeneous networks where participants may use different audio configurations while maintaining synchronized playback.
