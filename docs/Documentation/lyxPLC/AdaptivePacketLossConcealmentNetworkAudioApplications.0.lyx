 architecture combines multi-threaded packet buffering with Burg algorithm-based audio prediction to maintain continuous audio playback despite network packet loss.
 Key innovations include an adaptive worker thread that dynamically adjusts queue target sizes based on underrun patterns, per-channel autoregressive modeling for high-quality audio prediction, and comprehensive real-time performance monitoring.
 The system supports multiple audio channels, variable bit depths, and different frame sizes while maintaining low-latency operation suitable for interactive audio applications.
 Experimental evaluation demonstrates effective concealment of packet losses up to [X]% with minimal perceptual artifacts, while the adaptive queue management reduces underruns by [Y]% compared to fixed-size buffering approaches.
 The architecture's modular design enables deployment across various network audio scenarios, from music performance to voice communication systems.
 Statistical analysis reveals consistent performance under varying network conditions, with automatic adaptation to network jitter and variable latency patterns.
 The implementation provides a practical solution for maintaining audio quality in unreliable network environments while preserving the real-time constraints essential for interactive audio applications.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Network audio applications face significant challenges when operating over unreliable networks where packet loss, jitter, and variable latency can severely degrade audio quality.
 Traditional approaches to handling packet loss in audio streams typically involve either simple silence insertion or basic interpolation techniques, both of which produce audible artifacts that compromise the listening experience.
 For interactive applications such as networked music performance, voice communication, and remote audio collaboration, maintaining continuous, high-quality audio output is critical for user experience and application viability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem becomes particularly acute in real-time scenarios where buffering must be minimized to maintain interactive responsiveness.
 Unlike streaming applications that can afford larger buffers to smooth over network irregularities, interactive audio applications require solutions that balance audio quality preservation with minimal latency penalties.
 This necessitates sophisticated packet loss concealment strategies that can predict missing audio content with sufficient quality to mask brief interruptions.
