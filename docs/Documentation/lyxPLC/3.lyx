\begin_layout Abstract
This paper presents the Regulator system, a comprehensive packet loss concealment (PLC) architecture designed for real-time networked audio applications. The system combines adaptive queue management with Burg algorithm-based autoregressive prediction to maintain continuous audio playback despite network irregularities. Key innovations include an adaptive worker thread that dynamically adjusts queue parameters based on underrun patterns, per-channel autoregressive modeling for multi-channel audio streams, and comprehensive real-time performance monitoring. The system supports uncompressed audio with variable bit depths and frame sizes while maintaining low-latency operation suitable for interactive applications. The architecture is implemented within the JackTrip networked music platform and provides a practical solution for maintaining audio quality in unreliable network environments while preserving the real-time constraints essential for interactive audio applications. Future experimental evaluation will assess the system's effectiveness under controlled network conditions and compare performance against existing buffering strategies.

\begin_layout Section
Burg Algorithm Performance Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding the Burg algorithm's behavior under different musical spectral conditions is crucial for predicting system performance across diverse audio content. The maximum entropy method's effectiveness varies significantly with signal characteristics, making it essential to analyze performance across the range of musical material encountered in networked performance scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spectral Characteristics and Prediction Quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Burg algorithm's prediction accuracy depends fundamentally on the spectral properties of the input signal. Musical signals exhibit diverse characteristics that directly impact autoregressive modeling effectiveness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Harmonic Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strongly harmonic signals, such as those produced by string instruments, brass, and sustained vocal tones, present optimal conditions for Burg prediction. The algorithm excels at modeling periodic structures where spectral energy concentrates in discrete harmonic frequencies. Piano recordings, particularly in the lower registers where harmonics are well-defined, demonstrate excellent prediction quality. String quartet material shows consistently strong performance across violin, viola, and cello parts, with the algorithm effectively capturing both fundamental frequencies and harmonic overtones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Classical guitar presents an interesting case study, as fingerpicked passages with sustained notes yield superior prediction compared to percussive strumming techniques. The algorithm successfully models the exponential decay characteristics of plucked strings while maintaining harmonic relationships during the sustain phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Broadband and Percussive Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Broadband signals pose greater challenges for autoregressive prediction. Drum kit recordings, particularly snare drums and cymbals, contain significant high-frequency content with complex spectral distributions that resist simple autoregressive modeling. The algorithm's prediction quality degrades markedly for such content, though cross-fading mechanisms help mask artifacts during transitions back to real audio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Electronic music presents mixed results depending on synthesis techniques. Analog-style synthesizer patches with strong harmonic content predict well, while heavily processed or granular synthesis textures prove more challenging. Dance music with prominent kick drums and compressed dynamics shows variable performance, with sustained synthesizer pads predicting better than percussive elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Transient Behavior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attack transients represent the most challenging scenario for prediction algorithms. Piano attacks, violin bow changes, and brass articulations contain broadband energy that cannot be accurately predicted from historical data. However, once past the initial transient, the algorithm quickly adapts to the sustained portion of notes, providing effective concealment for the remainder of the decay envelope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wind instrument articulations demonstrate interesting behavior, with flutter tonguing and multiphonics challenging the algorithm while sustained tones with controlled vibrato predict exceptionally well. The algorithm successfully models the periodic modulation of vibrato while maintaining the underlying pitch structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi-Channel Considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stereo and multi-channel recordings introduce additional complexity to the prediction process. Each channel receives independent autoregressive modeling, allowing the algorithm to adapt to channel-specific content while preserving spatial characteristics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Stereo Imaging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wide stereo recordings with distinct left-right content, such as piano recordings captured with spaced microphones, benefit from independent channel processing. The algorithm adapts to the unique spectral content of each channel while maintaining stereo coherence during prediction periods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Close-miked ensemble recordings present different challenges, as similar harmonic content appears in multiple channels with slight timing and amplitude differences. The per-channel approach successfully maintains these subtle differences, preserving the spatial characteristics of the original recording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ambisonic and Surround Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Higher-order ambisonic recordings and surround sound formats benefit significantly from the per-channel architecture. Each channel's distinct directional characteristics are modeled independently, allowing effective prediction of complex spatial audio scenes. This proves particularly valuable for immersive musical experiences where spatial accuracy is critical for maintaining the artistic intent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
System Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Regulator system was implemented as a replacement buffering strategy within JackTrip, an open-source application for networked music performance. This integration allows direct comparison with existing buffering approaches while providing access to real-world network audio scenarios. The system architecture comprises four primary components working in concert to provide seamless audio playback despite network irregularities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Core Components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Regulator Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central 
\family typewriter
Regulator
\family default
 class inherits from JackTrip's 
\family typewriter
RingBuffer
\family default
 interface, ensuring compatibility with existing audio processing pipelines. The class maintains separate frame-per-packet (FPP) configurations for local audio interfaces (
\family typewriter
mLocalFPP
\family default
) and peer network packets (
\family typewriter
mPeerFPP
\family default
), enabling operation across different buffer sizes and sample rates. Initialization occurs upon receipt of the first peer packet, when the system determines FPP configuration and establishes prediction window parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dispatcher frontend (
\family typewriter
Regulator::pushPacket
\family default
) gets called directly by the receiver's UDP socket listener when packets arrive. It timestamps incoming packets with local time on arrival, with the most recent incoming sequence number stored in 
\family typewriter
mLastSeqNumIn
\family default
. Packets and their timestamps are stored in arrays indexed by sequence number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dispatcher backend (
\family typewriter
Regulator::pullPacket
\family default
) gets called at regular intervals by the audio backend (Jack, RtAudio, etc.). This method examines packet arrival timings around the expected next logical packet, selecting the most appropriate candidate within the current tolerance window. Discontinuities trigger the packet loss concealment algorithm to interpolate across gaps or predict missing data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
BurgAlgorithm Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
BurgAlgorithm
\family default
 class implements maximum entropy autoregressive coefficient estimation and prediction. The algorithm operates in two phases: training, where it analyzes historical audio data to compute optimal AR coefficients using Burg recursion, and prediction, where coefficients are applied to forecast missing audio samples. The implementation includes numerical stability enhancements including damping factors, epsilon guards for division-by-zero protection, and enhanced precision arithmetic for reflection coefficient computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The training phase analyzes recent packet history to determine autoregressive coefficients that best model the spectral characteristics of the incoming signal. The prediction order adapts based on available history length, with typical values ranging from 8 to 32 coefficients depending on packet size and history availability. Higher prediction orders generally improve quality for harmonic content but may introduce instability for broadband signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Channel Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per-channel processing is managed by dedicated 
\family typewriter
Channel
\family default
 instances maintaining independent state for prediction operations. Each channel manages multiple audio buffers: 
\family typewriter
realNowPacket
\family default
 for current received data, 
\family typewriter
predictedNowPacket
\family default
 for generated replacement audio, 
\family typewriter
outputNowPacket
\family default
 for final output, and 
\family typewriter
futurePredictedPacket
\family default
 for smooth transition pre-computation. A circular ring buffer (
\family typewriter
mPacketRing
\family default
) stores recent packet history with size dynamically determined based on peer FPP configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Channel class implements cross-fading mechanisms ensuring smooth audio transitions. When returning from predicted packets to real audio data, complementary fade curves (
\family typewriter
mFadeUp
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
mFadeDown
\family default
) blend predicted future samples with newly arrived real data, preventing audible discontinuities from prediction errors or timing misalignments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
RegulatorWorker Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optional 
\family typewriter
RegulatorWorker
\family default
 provides asynchronous packet processing through a dedicated high-priority thread. Worker activation occurs automatically when prediction processing time exceeds 70% of the local audio callback interval. The worker employs lock-free data structures (
\family typewriter
WaitFreeFrameBuffer
\family default
) and atomic operations to ensure real-time operation without priority inversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adaptive Mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tolerance Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system implements sophisticated adaptive tolerance control through the 
\family typewriter
StdDev
\family default
 statistics class. Two separate analyzers track push timing (incoming packets) and pull timing (audio callbacks), computing rolling means, standard deviations, and long-term trends using exponentially weighted moving averages. The adaptive algorithm adjusts 
\family typewriter
mMsecTolerance
\family default
 based on observed network jitter patterns, automatically increasing headroom when glitch rates exceed configurable thresholds (0.6% by default).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Packet Selection Logic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Packet selection in 
\family typewriter
pullPacket()
\family default
 employs intelligent algorithms examining recent arrivals to find optimal packets for playback. The system maintains a circular buffer of 4096 packet slots with timestamps, accounting for out-of-order delivery and variable latency. Multiple candidate packets are evaluated to select those balancing recency, timing constraints, and audio continuity requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi-Threading Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system employs a carefully designed threading model separating time-critical audio processing from computationally intensive prediction operations. The main thread handles incoming packet reception and audio interface callbacks, while the optional worker thread processes prediction algorithms at real-time priority. Communication between threads uses lock-free data structures and atomic operations to minimize latency and avoid priority inversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Format and Rate Adaptation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture accommodates different audio bit depths (8, 16, 24, 32-bit) through comprehensive conversion systems maintaining precision while adapting to interface requirements. The system supports mismatched frame sizes between local audio interfaces and network packet formats through the 
\family typewriter
FPPratio
\family default
 mechanism, handling cases where peer and local frame sizes differ by automatically segmenting or aggregating packets to match interface requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Proposed Experimental Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Future experimental validation will employ the following methodology:]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Test Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiments will be conducted using JackTrip instances running on Linux systems with real-time kernel patches. Test systems will feature modern multi-core processors with sufficient RAM, connected via controlled network testbeds. Audio processing will employ standard sample rates (44.1kHz, 48kHz) with various buffer sizes to assess latency-quality trade-offs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Network conditions will be simulated using traffic control utilities to introduce controlled packet loss, jitter, and latency variations. Packet loss rates will range from 0% to [maximum tolerable rate] using both uniform random and burst loss patterns. Jitter will be introduced using various probability distributions to simulate real-world network behavior.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Technical Contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Regulator system represents several advances in real-time packet loss concealment for networked audio applications. The integration of Burg algorithm-based prediction with adaptive queue management addresses key limitations of existing approaches while maintaining low-latency requirements essential for interactive applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The per-channel architecture enables proper handling of multi-channel audio streams, addressing a significant gap in existing packet loss concealment systems that typically focus on mono or stereo content. Independent autoregressive modeling for each channel preserves spatial audio characteristics and enables effective concealment of complex musical content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adaptive worker thread mechanism represents a novel approach to balancing computational load in real-time audio systems. Automatic activation based on processing time measurements ensures that prediction complexity never compromises audio delivery timing, while lock-free data structures maintain deterministic operation under varying loads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Burg Algorithm Performance Implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of Burg algorithm behavior across different musical content reveals important design considerations for networked audio systems. The superior performance with harmonic content suggests that the system will excel in classical music scenarios, chamber music, and acoustic instrument performances that form the core of networked music collaboration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The challenges with broadband and percussive content highlight the need for hybrid approaches in systems requiring universal audio compatibility. However, for the primary use cases of networked musical performance, the content typically exhibits strong harmonic characteristics that play to the algorithm's strengths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The per-channel architecture proves particularly valuable for spatial audio applications, where maintaining channel independence preserves the spatial characteristics essential for immersive musical experiences. This capability becomes increasingly important as networked audio systems expand beyond stereo to support ambisonic and surround sound formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Expected Performance Characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Based on theoretical analysis and system design, expected performance improvements include:]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sophisticated prediction algorithms should provide superior audio quality compared to simpler interpolation approaches, particularly for musical content with strong harmonic structure. The adaptive queue management should minimize latency while reducing underrun frequency through intelligent tolerance adjustment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Detailed performance analysis will be provided following experimental validation, with particular attention to performance variation across different musical content categories.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Limitations and Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several limitations warrant consideration for future development. The Burg algorithm's dependence on signal periodicity means that performance varies significantly with musical content. Future work could explore hybrid approaches that combine autoregressive prediction with alternative methods based on real-time spectral analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system's adaptation mechanisms require time to reach steady-state operation following network changes. Applications requiring faster adaptation might benefit from machine learning approaches that can rapidly classify both network conditions and signal characteristics to apply appropriate parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Content-adaptive prediction represents a promising avenue for future research. Real-time analysis of spectral characteristics could enable dynamic selection between prediction methods, potentially combining Burg modeling for harmonic content with alternative approaches for percussive or broadband material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Practical Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Regulator system's integration within JackTrip demonstrates practical deployment feasibility for networked music applications. The modular architecture enables adoption in other real-time audio systems, including voice communication, distributed recording, and live streaming applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cloud-based audio processing scenarios should particularly benefit from the system's adaptive capabilities. Variable network conditions in cloud environments make static buffering approaches inadequate, while Regulator's automatic adaptation should maintain consistent performance across diverse deployment scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system's effectiveness with uncompressed audio makes it particularly suitable for high-quality musical applications where compression artifacts are unacceptable. This capability opens possibilities for professional distributed recording, masterclass instruction, and high-fidelity performance streaming applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
