Demand Valve Engagement (Flow Slackens): When a diver inhales, the pressure within the second stage mouthpiece decreases slightly below the surrounding water pressure. This pressure difference causes a diaphragm inside the second stage to flex inward. This action operates a lever that opens a valve, allowing air to flow from the first stage (which has already reduced the high-pressure tank air to an intermediate pressure) into the mouthpiece. As the diver inhales, air continues to flow until the pressure inside the mouthpiece equalizes with the ambient water pressure, providing a comfortable breath. When the diver stops inhaling, the diaphragm relaxes, releasing the lever and closing the valve, stopping the airflow. This is how the regulator delivers air "on demand".
Pressure Relief (Flow Exceeds Demand): Most modern second-stage regulators utilize a "downstream" valve mechanism. In this design, if the intermediate pressure from the first stage becomes too high (e.g., due to a malfunction in the first stage, known as a "free flow"), the downstream valve acts as an overpressure relief. The excess pressure will overcome the spring-bias holding the valve closed, causing it to open and release the excess air, preventing damage to the hoses or a potentially hazardous overinflation of buoyancy devices. 

In essence, the SCUBA regulator's second stage is designed to provide air precisely when needed (on demand) while also having a built-in safety mechanism to handle situations where the incoming airflow becomes excessive.
