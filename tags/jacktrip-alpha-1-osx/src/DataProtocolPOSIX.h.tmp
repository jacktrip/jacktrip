/** \brief Base class that defines the transmission protocol.
 * 
 * This base class defines most of the common method to setup and connect
 * sockets using the individual protocols (UDP, TCP, SCTP, etc).
 *
 * The class has to be constructed using one of two modes (runModeT):\n
 * - SENDER
 * - RECEIVER
 *
 * This has to be specified as a constructor argument. When using, create two instances
 * of the class, one to receive and one to send packets. Each instance will run on a
 * separate thread.
 *
 * Redundancy and forward error correction should be implemented on each
 * Transport protocol, cause they depend on the protocol itself
 *
 * \todo This Class should contain definition of jacktrip header and basic funcionality to obtain
 * local machine IPs and maybe functions to manipulate IPs.
 * Redundancy and forward error correction should be implemented on each
 * Transport protocol, cause they depend on the protocol itself
 *
 * \todo The transport protocol itself has to be implemented subclassing this class, i.e.,
 * using a TCP or UDP protocol.
 *
 * Even if the underlined transmission protocol is stream oriented (as in TCP),
 * we send packets that are the size of the audio processing buffer.
 * Use AudioInterface::getBufferSize to obtain this value.
 *
 * Each transmission (i.e., inputs and outputs) run on its own thread.
