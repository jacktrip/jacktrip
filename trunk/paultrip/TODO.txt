High Priority TODOS:

- ProcessPlugins working, need to set the faust compiler to generate approprate classes. Also, add the offset option to process starting from a different channel
- add and read header
- add queue lengths (settings of ring buffer)
- add bit rate multipliers
- Propertely implement the PaulTrip class, now it is too protorypee

- Verify RingBuffer, when in a mac the connection is done when something is already sending packets, the delay is much smaller that the case when the peer connect later.

Also, there's a buzz when there's no connection that shouldn't happen, is should just send zeros.

- Verify why loopback is just duplicating one channel instead of using stereo.
