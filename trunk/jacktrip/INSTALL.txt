Jacktrip : Build Instructions for Linux and MacOS X

JackTrip: A System for High-Quality Audio Network Performance over the Internet.

---
MacOS X (10.3.9 or higher) Installation:

If you are installing on MacOS X, a universal binary is provided.  You just need to have JackOSX installed on your machine
http://www.jackosx.com/

To install (using Terminal): go to bin/ directory and type:

   sudo cp jacktrip /usr/bin/
   (enter your password when prompted)

   sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/jacktrip
   (now you can run jacktrip from any directory using Terminal)


---
Dependencies:

You need to have installed the libraries in your system:
qt4-devel
jack-audio-connection-kit-devel

If you are using yum (in Fedora 8 or later) you can just install them (as root) with:
   yum install qt4-devel jack-audio-connection-kit-devel

If you want to build on MacOS X, you need JackOSX
http://www.jackosx.com/
and Qt 4.5 or higher.

Build:

If you're on Mac OS X or Fedora Linux and have all the dependencies installed,
you can build by simply going to the /src directory and typing the following:
    ./build

If you want to build without Jack support (meaning that you won't need jack installed
to use the app) type the following:
   ./build nojack

If the previous script doesn't work on a different Linux flavor, try building
the Makfiles yourself. You'd need qmake (e.g., on Fedora, this command is called
qmake-qt4). Then you can build by:
    qmake jacktrip.pro
    make release

Or without Jack support:
   qmake -config nojack jacktrip.pro
   make release


If you want to install install (using Terminal): on the /src directory type:

   sudo cp jacktrip /usr/bin/
   (enter your password when prompted)

   sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/jacktrip
   (now you can run jacktrip from any directory using Terminal)
