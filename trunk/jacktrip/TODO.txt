High Priority TODOS:

- ProcessPlugins working, need to set the faust compiler to generate approprate classes. Also, add the offset option to process starting from a different channel
- add and read header
- add queue lengths (settings of ring buffer)
- Propertely implement the PaulTrip class, now it is too protorypee

- Verify why loopback is just duplicating one channel instead of using stereo.

TODOS: Add header into packet, and add redundancy to UDP
- Loopback is not working the way it is implements in JackAudioInterface
 need to fix this maybe using an internal client


- TEST SOURCEFORGE
