# JackTrip is a Linux, Mac OSX, or Windows multi-machine audio system used for network music performance over the Internet.
It supports any number of channels (as many as the computer/network can handle) of bidirectional, high quality, uncompressed audio signal streaming.

You can use it between any combination of machines e.g., one end using Linux can connect to another using Mac OSX.

QJackTrip has now been merged with the original code to provide an optional graphical user interface for the program. If run with no arguments, the program will default to GUI mode. If arguments are supplied then it will run on the terminal.

# Other Repos
jacktrip (1.0) was released on google code. When that shut down, it migrated to github (1.05, 1.1).
It then moved to the CCRMA's cm-gitlab for version 1.2.
And as of spring 2020 it moved back to GitHub for the current development.
