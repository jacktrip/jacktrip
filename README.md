# JackTrip #

**JackTrip** is a Linux and Mac OS X-based system used for multi-machine network performance over the Internet. It supports any number of channels (as many as the computer/network can handle) of bidirectional, high quality, uncompressed audio signal streaming.

You can use it between any combination of Linux and Mac OS X (i.e., one end using Linux can connect to the other using Mac OS X).
