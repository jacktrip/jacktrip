Jacktrip : Build Instructions for Linux and MacOS X

JackTrip: A System for High-Quality Audio Network Performance over the Internet.

---
MacOS X (10.9 or higher) installation:

If you are installing on MacOS X, a binary is provided with each release (download the latest release from https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip/releases before proceeding).
You need to have a working jack installation on your machine (see below).

To install (using Terminal):

$ git clone https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip.git
$ cd jacktrip/src
$ sudo cp jacktrip /usr/local/bin/
  (enter your password when prompted)

$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/jacktrip
  (now you can run jacktrip from any directory using Terminal)



To build using QtCreator (tested using QtCreator 4.11 and macOS 10.13.6):

  * Open jacktrip.pro using QtCreator
  * Choose a correctly configured Kit
  * Install Jack:
    brew install jack
    brew install qjackctl

Fedora installation (also tested on Ubuntu Studio):

To install on Fedora (and possibly other Linux distributions), you need qt5, jack-audio-connection-kit-devel, and rtaudio.

How to install qt5 and other needed tools on Fedora: 
dnf install qt5-devel
dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"
dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
dnf install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel alsa-lib-devel iperf qjackctl audacity git

Ubuntu Studio already comes with jack and qjackctl but you may have to install libjack-dev. Other basic tools can be installed on Ubuntu with:

sudo apt install build-essential


For rtaudio, if you donâ€™t have the latest package, install from source:

$ git clone https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio
$ cd rtaudio
$ bash autogen.sh
$ ./configure --with-jack
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/librtaudio.so.6 /lib64/

Then to install jacktrip:

$ git clone https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip.git
$ cd jacktrip/src
$ ./build
$ sudo make install


---
Dependencies:

You need to have installed the libraries in your system:
Qt 5.3 or higher
jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
rtaudio

If you are using yum you can just install them (as root) with:
   yum install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
and install qt from the qt site.

If you want to build on MacOS X, you need JackOSX
http://www.jackosx.com/
and Qt 5.3 or higher.

It is also possible to build without jack, see below.

Build:

If you're on Mac OS X or Fedora Linux and have all the dependencies installed,
you can build by simply going to the /src directory and typing the following:
    ./build

If you want to build without Jack support (meaning that you won't need jack installed
to use the app) type the following:
   ./build nojack

If the previous script doesn't work on a different Linux flavor, try building
the Makefiles yourself. You'd need qmake. Then you can build by:
$ qmake jacktrip.pro
$ make release

Or without Jack support:
$ qmake -config nojack jacktrip.pro
$ make release


If you want to install (using Terminal): on the /builddir directory type:

$ sudo cp jacktrip /usr/local/bin/
  (enter your password when prompted)

$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/jacktrip
  (now you can run jacktrip from any directory using Terminal)

WINDOWS (XP and later)

Dependencies:

- ASIO4all audio driver is required even with Audio interfaces that support ASIO: www.asio4all.com

Installation:

Simply Run the setup file Jacktrip-1.1.exe, which will unpack Jacktrip in the directory of your choice,
the default is Program Files/Jacktrip.

The installer also adds the executable Jacktrip.exe in the System32 directory, so that it can be executed
from a command prompt from any working directory.

This executable (jacktrip.exe) can be found in the bin directory, along with the Dynamic
Link Libraries (DLLs) it links to.


Building:

The easiest way to build is to download the free Qt Creator IDE from https://www.qt.io/download since the jacktrip buildscript is written in qmake.

Use `git clone https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip.git` to download a fresh copy of the repo.
Open the `src/jacktrip.pro` and configure the project.

Make sure to select the MinGW compiler (for example the one shipped with QtCreator).
Building with Clang or Microsoft Visual Studio Compilers is currently not supported!


Download Jack2 from https://jackaudio.org/downloads/
Make sure to install Jack into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack` (as this is the path where the jacktrip build script will look for it).

Hit build in QtCreator.

Note: compiling with modifications in the .pro file (like adding a new source or header file) requires
qmake which is only available in the Qt Creator package.

BUILD WARNING

Always keep the /src and /externals directories under the same directory.
